Week Report 1:
Team activities:
As a team, we refined requirements of project, applied object-oriented analysis and design
and prototype a auser interface. Firstly, on Monday, all team members sitted together and read  
requirements of project, and make a roughly agreement on how should we design the whole
project. Then, we break down the work which will show at the bottom of report. Finishing 
everyone's part costs about three days. After that, on Thursday, we sitted together again
and merge our work together and do a little bit modification on them.
