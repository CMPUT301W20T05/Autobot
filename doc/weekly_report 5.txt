As a team: We try our best to finish our code, such as completeing information, 
offline issues, driver connecting to riders, requets list, unit test and so on.

As a member:
zonglun1: Write the status change notify function in database, shared preferences for offline,
modify basic classes, update currentlocation.
Weida:Write the rate and profile photo upload to firebase, modify come class.

Comment:
zonglun1: Our data structure is kind of dummy so that we can not make the database realtime.
weida:Firebase really let me confused about its thread and work principle.
