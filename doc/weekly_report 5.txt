Comment:
zonglun1: Our data structure is kind of dummy so that we can not make the database realtime.
yiping1: We did really good this week on remote work, but as we develop our app, we found that
we need to store more data type into our database, which makes it so difficult for us.
xqiu1: we need do more generalizations.
